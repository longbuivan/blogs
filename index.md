## **About me**

Hello World,

I am a full time Data Engineer - Data System Architect and Writer in my free time.

I work for an IT company locates in Ho Chi Minh City but I mostly work from home and I travel for work a lot.

In my working, I bring meaningful data from multiple sources into production. I go really fast if I work alone but I can also collaborate well in a team. In my current team, we process valuable data for customers in large corporations. Design, Implement and Deploy systems is the main part of my current task.

In my free time, I like to read and communicate with people for knowledge sharing and network expanding. And another favorite hobby of mine is taking photos.

I usually spend a lot of time for reading and studying about various system designs and how to bring them to real environment.

Most of my personal project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/longbuivan)
