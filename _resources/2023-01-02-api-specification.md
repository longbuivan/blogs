## How do we define the Application Protocol Interface aka API

### - Description

The API documentation uses to describe how the API service can help the application to interact among different applications or systems.
With business-driven, the API is implemented in a way that makes it easy to create applications as simple as possible.

### - Authentication

Is a crucial part of API design and should be included in the API specification.
There are various authentication methods that can be used with an API, such as OAuth, API keys, or username and password. The API specification should define the authentication method(s) that the API uses and how clients can authenticate themselves to access the API.

### - Endpoints

The URL path where clients can access different resources or functionalities of the API.

### - Parameters

The input values that clients must provide to access different endpoints of the API, along with any validation rules and data types.

### - Responses

The output values that the API returns in response to client requests, along with any possible error messages or status codes.

### - Data models

The structures and formats of the data that the API uses to represent different resources, such as JSON or XML.

### - API endpoints and methods

The API specification should list all of the endpoints that the API supports and the methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that can be used to interact with those endpoints.

### - Request and response formats

The API specification should define the formats for requests and responses, including data types, formats, and any constraints or validation rules that apply.

### - Error handling

The API specification should define the error handling approach for the API, including error codes, messages, and any expected behavior from clients in response to errors.

### - Rate limiting

The API specification should define the rate limiting approach, including the maximum number of requests that can be made per minute or other time period.

### - Versioning

The API specification should define how API versions are managed and how clients can specify the version of the API they want to use.
